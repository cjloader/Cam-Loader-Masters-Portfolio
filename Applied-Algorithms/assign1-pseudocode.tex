\begin{enumerate}
	\item Show how this algorithm works on the following strings using pseudo code:
	\begin{enumerate}
	   \item rester
	    \begin{itemize}
	    	\item String "rester" entered into the console
	    	\item checks if it is Q, if not isPalidrome(rester) is called
	    	\item checks that 'r' matches 'r' and calls isPalindrome('este')
	    	\item checks 'e' matches 'e', calls isPalindrome('st')
	    	\item fails on 's' compared to 't' and returns false    
	    \end{itemize}
	  \item able was i ere i saw elba
	  \begin{itemize}
	  	\item String "able was i ere i saw elba" entered in the console
	  	\item check if it is Q, if not isPalidrome('able was i ere i saw elba') is called
        \item checks that 'a' matches 'a' and calls  isPalindrome('ble was i ere i saw elb')
        \item checks that 'b' matches 'b and calls    isPalindrome('le was i ere i saw el')
	  	\item checks that 'l' matches 'l' and calls isPalindrome('e was i ere i saw e')
	  	\item checks that 'e' matches 'e' and calls  isPalindrome(' was i ere i saw ')
	  	\item checks that ' ' matches ' ' and calls  isPalindrome(' was i ere i saw ')
	  	\item checks that 'w' matches 'w' and calls  isPalindrome('as i ere i sa')
	  	\item checks that 'a' matches 'a' and calls  isPalindrome('s i ere i s ')
	  	\item checks that 's' matches '' and calls  isPalindrome(' was i ere i saw ')
	  	\item checks that ' ' matches ' ' and calls  isPalindrome('i ere i')
	  	\item checks that 'i' matches 'i' and calls  isPalindrome(' ere ')
	  	\item checks that ' ' matches ' ' and calls  isPalindrome('ere')
	  	\item checks that 'e' matches 'e' and calls  isPalindrome('r')
	  	\item 'r' is the last char, return true
	  \end{itemize}
	\end{enumerate}
